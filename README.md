# pokeapi

1 - First we need to understand how the API works and what calls do we have to do;
2 - We have to map all the models that will be used by the app when consuming the API;
3 - I used the MVP architecture because this is the most used architecture by me;
4 - I tried to show display the pokemons in a list with the details with transitions and animations;
5 - Some libraries are used by me to be more effective in my development: Retrofit, OkHttp;
6 - I'm using Dagger 2 to class injections;
7 - I made some animations and transitions to show my skills in this area;
